# MobControl
This plugin allows you to control any mob you want!
Right click on it, or select an option in your hotbar.
NOTE: This plugin is based off of Dream's videos, but all of the
code in this plugin was written by me.

### Commands
All of the commands are accessed by using `/mobcontrol`.  
`\mobcontrol set [player]` allows you to set the person who will be controlling mobs. They will have the options added
into their hotbar, mobs will stop attacking them, and they will be invisible.
`\mobcontrol remove [player]` undoes everything the previous command did. They will be visible again, their inventories
will be cleaned, and mobs will attack them again.
